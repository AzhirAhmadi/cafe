This may happen for two reasons:

1) You forgot to wrap your route inside the scope block. For example:

2) You are testing a Devise controller bypassing the router.

[Devise] Could not find devise mapping for path "/api/login.json".
This may happen for two reasons:

1) You forgot to wrap your route inside the scope block. For example:

  devise_scope :user do
    get "/some/route" => "some_devise_controller"
  end

2) You are testing a Devise controller bypassing the router.
   If so, you can explicitly tell Devise which mapping to use:

Processing by DeviseApi::SessionsController#create as JSON
  Parameters: {"user"=>"11"}
[Devise] Could not find devise mapping for path "/api/login.json".
This may happen for two reasons:

1) You forgot to wrap your route inside the scope block. For example:

  devise_scope :user do
    get "/some/route" => "some_devise_controller"
  end

2) You are testing a Devise controller bypassing the router.
   If so, you can explicitly tell Devise which mapping to use:

   @request.env["devise.mapping"] = Devise.mappings[:user]

  Parameters: {"user"=>{"email"=>"test1@player.com", "password"=>"[FILTERED]"}}
[Devise] Could not find devise mapping for path "/api/login".
This may happen for two reasons:

1) You forgot to wrap your route inside the scope block. For example:

  devise_scope :user do
    get "/some/route" => "some_devise_controller"
  end

2) You are testing a Devise controller bypassing the router.
   If so, you can explicitly tell Devise which mapping to use:

   @request.env["devise.mapping"] = Devise.mappings[:user]
